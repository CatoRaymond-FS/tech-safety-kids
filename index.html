            <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
            <p>Computers are tools that help us do many things like writing, drawing, and even playing games. They have parts that work together to make everything run smoothly!</p>
            <h3>Basic Parts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> This is the screen where you see everything you do.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> This is where you type words and numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Mouse:</strong> This helps you point, click, and move around the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> Think of it as the "brain" of the computer that makes everything work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each part has a special job, and they all work together to let you use the computer for fun and learning!</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Getting Around the Screen</h2>
            <p>Now that you know about the computer parts, let's talk about how to use them!</p>
            <h3>Using the Mouse and Keyboard:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Left Click:</strong> Click on things you want to open or select.</li>
                <li><strong>Right Click:</strong> This opens a menu with more choices.</li>
                <li><strong>Scroll Wheel:</strong> This lets you move up and down on pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Typing:</strong> Use the keyboard to type letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Understanding the Desktop, Files, and Folders:</h3>
            <p>The <strong>desktop</strong> is the main screen where you see all your icons. These icons are like shortcuts to programs and files.</p>
            <p><strong>Files</strong> are where you keep your work or documents, and <strong>folders</strong> help you organize them so they don’t get lost.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> It's important to keep your schoolwork organized in folders so you can find it easily later!</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>What is a Browser?</h3>
            <p>A <strong>browser</strong> is the program you use to explore the internet. Popular browsers include Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. It's like your "vehicle" to travel around the internet!</p>
